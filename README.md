## Watcher

Watcher is an automated movie NZB searcher and snatcher. You can add a list of wanted movies and Watcher will automatically send the NZB to Sabnzbd or NZBGet. Watcher also has basic post-processing capabilities such as renaming and moving.

Watcher is a work in progress and plans to add more features in the future, but we will always prioritize speed and stability over features.

Watcher may change frequently, so we strongly suggest you subscribe to the subreddit [/r/watcher](https://www.reddit.com/r/watcher/) to stay informed of any announcements, feature discussion, or events that require user interaction.

Refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/nosmokingbandit/watcher/wiki) for more information about post-processing, start scripts, and other features.

## Installation

Watcher requires [Python 2.7.9](https://www.python.org/) or newer. If you are running OSX or *nix you probably have python 2.7 already. If you do not, or are on Windows, make sure you install Python.

It is also strongly recommended that you install [GIT](http://git-scm.com/). This will allow you to update much more easily.
